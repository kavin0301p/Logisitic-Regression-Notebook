Logistic Regression Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression, a fundamental algorithm for binary classification problems in machine learning.

Overview
Logistic Regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. In this notebook, we explore the following:

Introduction to Logistic Regression
Dataset overview
Data preprocessing
Model training
Model evaluation
Visualization of results
Structure
Logistic_Regression_Notebook.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations.
data/: Directory containing the dataset used in the notebook.
images/: Directory containing images and plots generated by the notebook.
Installation
To run the notebook on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/kavin0301p/Logisitic-Regression-Notebook.git
cd Logisitic-Regression-Notebook
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Jupyter Notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook
Open the Logistic_Regression_Notebook.ipynb notebook and run the cells.

Usage
The notebook is designed to be self-explanatory, with comments and markdown cells explaining each step of the process. Users can follow along and modify the code as needed to experiment with different datasets or parameters.
